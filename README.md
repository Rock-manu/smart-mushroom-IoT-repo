# 🍄 Smart Mushroom Farming System

An IoT-based smart mushroom cultivation system that automatically monitors and controls environmental conditions to optimize mushroom growth. The project uses ESP32, Raspberry Pi, sensors, actuators, and a web dashboard to provide real-time monitoring, automation, and remote management.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

Mushroom cultivation requires precise environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, and lighting. Manual monitoring is time-consuming and can lead to inconsistent yields.

The Smart Mushroom Farming System automates these processes by continuously monitoring the growing environment and controlling the necessary equipment to maintain ideal conditions for healthy mushroom production.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Monitor environmental conditions in real time
- Automatically regulate mushroom growing conditions
- Reduce manual labour
- Improve mushroom yield and quality
- Enable remote monitoring through an IoT dashboard
- Store environmental data for analysis and future prediction

# ⚙️ Working Principle

1. Sensors continuously measure environmental conditions.
2. ESP32 reads all sensor values.
3. Sensor data is transmitted to the Raspberry Pi.
4. Raspberry Pi stores the data in a database.
5. Dashboard displays live environmental conditions.
6. If any parameter exceeds predefined thresholds:
   - Fan turns ON
   - Humidifier activates
   - Heater activates
   - Lights switch ON/OFF
   - Water pump irrigates when required
7. Users can remotely monitor the system through the dashboard.
